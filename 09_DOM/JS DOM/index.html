    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>

    
    <p id="description">
      In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
      head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the
      idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books
      and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As
      with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of
      his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography,
      Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a
      great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee
      stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding
      in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become
      unsure of whether or not this is true.
